                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm William, but I go by Will! I recently moved to Colorado with my partner and am currently studying Applied Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a background in computer engineering and a passion for technology, from software development to automation and hardware projects. I enjoy building things that solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn new skills. Right now, I’m looking for internship or full-time opportunities in software development or tech support where I can apply my knowledge and grow as a developer. In my free time, I love working on personal coding projects and exploring the outdoors. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
