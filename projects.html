                        <p> This project implements various functions in order to recreate the RSA encryption method.
                             The functions produced compute various actions in order to encode and decode encrypted messages. 
                             This project takes use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to easily deduce the factors 
                             and remainders of very large complex numbers. It has been found that the basic %(modulo) 
                             operator's time complexity is O(n) of the use of the Euclidean algorithm and FME thus making this method nearly unbreakable.
                             We can generate a private key which will be used to decode the message. NOTE: **The functions produced in this project were 
                             created in line with the known arithemtic surrounding the RSA encryption technique.**</p>
